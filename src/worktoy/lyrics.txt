Oh no! You invoked the dreaded n00bError!

You were a n00b, star import so true
I knew you shouldn't, but you went and threw
All your code into the abyss, oh no
Now you're facing the consequences, don't you know?

Control yourself, don't go astray
Importing * will lead you astray
All the modules in disarray, oh dear
It's time to learn, my friend, have no fear

Oh, oh, oh
Run wild with imports, you thought you'd be fine
Oh, oh, oh
But now you're stuck in an exception, it's a sign

The n00bError rises, it's here to say
Importing everything, no, not today
Be selective, choose what you require
Clean code and sanity will inspire

So go on, refactor your import ways
Only bring what you need, make it a craze
Leave the stars behind, embrace clarity
And your code will shine with prosperity

Oh, oh, oh
No more wild star imports, it's a new day
Oh, oh, oh
Let's write clean code, the proper way

Remember, my friend, importing * can be tempting
But it's time to learn, no more reckless venting
Choose your imports wisely, make them shine
And your code will stand the test of time

Oh, oh, oh
No more wild star imports, it's a new day
Oh, oh, oh
Let's write clean code, the proper way
