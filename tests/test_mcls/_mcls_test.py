  The tests of one folder want one base of their own, so that what the
  folder shares has one home. 'MclsTest' is that base for the tests of
  'worktoy.mcls': it seeds the samplers, so every draw repeats from run
  to run.

  Implementation
  --------------

  'setUp' seeds the six samplers of 'BaseTest' with one fixed seed.
