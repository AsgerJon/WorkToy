# Code of Conduct

## Objective

This project is dedicated exclusively to technical development and
improvement. It is structured as a purely technical forum without any social
or non-technical interactions facilitated or endorsed by the project
maintainers.

## Nomenclature

- Person: Includes any real human person or open source AI system.
  Specifically excluded are any legal entities and other imaginary
  constructs.
- BDFL - Benevolent Dictator for Life
- Maintainers: Project maintainers
- Contributions: Any issue or pull request or similar submitted to the
  project requiring maintainer review. This includes rejected and accepted
  contributions.
- Contributor: Any person having submitted a contribution as defined
  above to the project.
- Core contributor: A contributor not appointed as a maintainer having
  made significant contributions to the project.
- Topical: Pertaining to the technical aspects of the project
- Non-Topical: Any subject of discussion not directly related to the
  technical development of the project
- Review: The process of evaluating the technical merits of a contribution
- External reviewer: A person appointed by maintainers to review or
  assist in reviewing contributions.
- Candidate: A person or AI considered for the role of external reviewer
- Candidate evaluation: The process of evaluating a candidate for a
  particular role.
- Good faith: The assumption that a contribution is an honest attempt at
  improving the project.
- Bad faith: Determining that a contribution is made such that in the opinion
  of maintainers it is not an honest attempt at improving the project.
- External conduct: Any behavior or activity of a person not related to
  the project.
- Community: There is no community here. Community requires contact with
  other real humans.

### Maintainer Review

This section defines the review process for contributions.

- Immediate acceptance: This is the case when a contribution is
  determined to advance the project. With this outcome, implementation
  of the contribution becomes an open task immediately.
- Conditional acceptance: When a contribution is determined to advance
  the project, but requiring only trivial improvements to be accepted.
- Challenge accepted: When a contribution would advance the project,
  provided that a significant and non-trivial problem is solved.
- Honorably archived: When a contribution would not advance the project
  without solving significant and non-trivial problems that are left
  unsolved by the contribution, but where the contribution reflects an
  honest effort towards advancing the project. Persons submitting any
  contribution received this outcome grants the person submitting
  status as contributor.
- Rejected: When a contribution is determined to not advance the
  project and where the contribution in the opinion of maintainers does
  not reflect an honest effort towards advancing the project.

### Maintainer Group Responsibilities

This section defines what responsibilities may only be taken by the group
of maintainers or by the BDFL.

- Procedures for accepting contributions and distributing releases. There
  must be only one procedure for accepting contributions. There must be
  exactly one central procedure for official releases. This procedure
  must specify release types and specify upstream hosts for each. Anyone
  is free to distribute releases in any package manager subject to the
  AGPL-3.0 license.

- The group of maintainers will not settle disputes related to unofficial
  releases.

- The group of maintainers may decide to link to unofficial releases made
  by package managers enjoying a good reputation in the open source
  community. Delisting such links is at the discretion of the group of
  maintainers. Potential reasons for delisting include, but are not
  limited to:
  - Untimely listing of new releases.
  - Changes or additions from the official release sufficient to
    constitute a fork.

- Where multiple package managers provide unofficial releases aimed at
  the same platform or otherwise in competition with each other, the
  group of maintainers will make a decision as to which are listed. This
  decision will be stated next to the listing.

- Individual maintainers are entirely free to disagree with the group
  both in private and in public. Disagreements will not be taken into
  consideration when evaluating future maintainership.

- The BDFL makes all final decision on behalf of the group. While group
  maintainers are free to disagree with the BDFL even in public,
  remaining in the maintainer group is understood by the BDFL to mean
  support.

- External reviewers may be appointed by the group of maintainers, but
  each individual maintainer is free to appoint external reviewers
  according to their own judgment.

### Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are those appointed by the BDFL to help manage the project.
They are tasked with accepting and reviewing contributions either
personally or by appointing external reviewers. Maintainers are free to
appoint external reviewers according to their own judgment, subject to
the conditions described below.

### Appointment of Reviewers

Maintainers are free to appoint external reviewers. Such appointments are
grouped into several categories:

- Personal acquaintance: Maintainers may appoint external reviewers
  based on personal acquaintance, if the acquaintance would not
  otherwise be likely to merit such appointment. In this case, the
  personal relationship must be disclosed to the group of maintainers.
  Please note that this has no effect on the evaluation of the
  contributions made by the appointed reviewer.

- General expertise: Maintainers should appoint as external reviewers any
  person expressing interest and having the technical competence to do so.
  If unable or even unwilling to accept managing the person as an
  external reviewer, the maintainer should refer the person to another
  maintainer or to the BDFL. If personal reasons are the reason for
  reluctance, the maintainer are encouraged to disclose this to the BDFL.

- Specific expertise: When deciding on the technical competence of a
  candidate, maintainers may narrow the area of competence considered to
  a particular area of the project. A reviewer appointed this way will
  have the same status as a general reviewer, but with a narrower focus.

- When evaluating the technical competence of a candidate, only
  contributions made to open source projects may be considered. If no
  such is available, but the candidate has connections to commercial
  ventures that indicate technical competence, a maintainer may appoint
  the reviewer, but it will be considered as a personal acquaintance
  appointment.

- A maintainer is responsible for the tasks completed by an external
  reviewer appointed by them.

### External Reviewer Responsibilities

This section defines the responsibilities of external reviewers.
External reviewers are appointed by maintainers to assist in the review
process.

- External reviewers are required to advice maintainers on their
  ability to review contributions. This includes both their technical
  competence, time availability and their personal interest in the
  particular contribution.

- External reviewers are free to be selective in what tasks they accept.

- External reviewers shall at all times be free to adjust their time
  commitment without prior notice or warning.

- External reviewers are prohibited from promising or guaranteeing any
  specific effort towards the furtherance of the project.

### Policy on LLM-Generated Code Contributions

This project explicitly rejects the proposition that code contributed to this
project—whether authored by a human, generated by a large language model (
LLM), or produced by any other automated system—can be considered proprietary
by any third party, including commercial entities or LLM vendors.

All contributions are, without exception, licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license
upon submission.
No claim of proprietary ownership by an LLM provider or any commercial entity
will be recognized or enforced with respect to any code contributed to this
project.

### Concluding Remarks

For the purpose of full disclosure, the previous paragraph pertaining to
the policy on LLM-generated code contributions, was itself generated by
ChatGPT 4.1 on July 15, 2025.

This Code of Conduct aims at being open and transparent in accepting
contributions under the AGPL-3.0 license. This license is chosen to
demonstrate agreement with the ideals of the Free Software Foundation and
the Open Source Initiative.

Any disputes related to this Code of Conduct will be settled solely by
the BDFL.
