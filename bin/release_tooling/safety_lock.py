"""
This script locks every safety file beside it. The four files
'rc.safety', 'micro.safety', 'minor.safety' and 'major.safety' guard the
release workflows that publish something irreversible: a release
candidate, which closes the dev window of its version for good, and the
three official releases. A locked safety holds the sole word 'STOP'. The
author arms one by hand, replacing 'STOP' with 'ALLOW' and committing,
right before pressing the button of the workflow it guards.

Every release workflow, the dev workflow included, locks the safeties in
its first job, so no run of any workflow leaves one armed: an arming is
spent by the next press of any button, whatever that press goes on to do.
The dev workflow runs this script, since it answers to no safety. The
guarded workflows run 'safety_check.py', which reads the one safety it
answers to and then performs this same lock. The files are written whether
or not they exist, so a missing safety comes back locked.
