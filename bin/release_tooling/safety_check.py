"""
This script decides whether a guarded release workflow may run, and locks
every safety whatever it decides. It requires one argument naming the
channel the workflow publishes, one of either:
- 'rc'
- 'micro'
- 'minor'
- 'major'
and reads the safety file of that name beside it, 'minor.safety' for
'minor'. The verdict is 'ALLOW' when that file holds the sole word
'ALLOW', which the author wrote by hand and committed before pressing the
button, and 'STOP' for any other content, or for no file at all. The
workflow checks out the commit the button was pressed on, so the state of
the file at that moment decides, and nothing pushed afterwards changes
the verdict.

Having read the file, the script writes 'STOP' into every safety file,
the one it read included, so an arming is spent by the press of the
button whether the run goes on or not. An optional second argument names
an environment variable: when given, the verdict is exported under that
name through 'GITHUB_ENV', the channel GitHub Actions uses to pass a
value to later steps, which push the lock first and act on the verdict
after; when omitted, the verdict is only printed. The script exits 0 on
either verdict, since the workflow must push the lock before it fails or
continues; a non-zero exit reports a usage or file error alone.
