"""
This script decides whether a press of a release button may run, and
locks every safety whatever it decides. It requires one argument naming
the button, which is the name of its workflow file, one of:
- 'dev', 'dev-minor', 'dev-major'
- 'rc', 'rc-minor', 'rc-major'
- 'lts-micro', 'lts-minor', 'lts-major'

First, a press on any branch but 'main' is refused before anything is
read or written, with exit code 6, so the job stops there and pushes
nothing to that branch. GitHub Actions names the branch in 'GITHUB_REF';
outside GitHub Actions, where it is unset, the check is passed over.

The release state machine in 'release_state.py' then decides the press
from 'VERSION': refused, free, or armed. An armed press runs only when the
safety file of the button holds the sole word 'ALLOW', which the author
wrote by hand and committed before pressing the button. The workflow
checks out the commit the button was pressed on, so the state of both
files at that moment decides, and nothing pushed afterwards changes the
verdict. The verdict is 'ALLOW' for a free press and for an armed press
whose safety read 'ALLOW', 'STOP' for an armed press whose safety read
anything else or was missing, and 'REFUSED' for a refused press or a
'VERSION' that cannot be read.

Having decided, the script writes 'STOP' into all nine safety files, the
one it read included, so an arming is spent by the press of any button
whether the run goes on or not. An optional second argument names an
environment variable: when given, the verdict is exported under that
name, and the message explaining it under that name followed by
'_MESSAGE', through 'GITHUB_ENV', the channel GitHub Actions uses to
pass a value to later steps, which push the lock first and act on the
verdict after; when omitted, the verdict is only printed. The script
exits 0 on every verdict, since the workflow must push the lock before it
fails or continues; a non-zero exit reports a usage or file error, or a
press on another branch.
