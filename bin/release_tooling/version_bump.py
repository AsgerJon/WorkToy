"""
This script records a published press in the 'VERSION' file. It requires
one argument naming the button that just published, which is the name of
its workflow file, one of:
- 'micro-dev', 'micro-rc', 'micro-lts'
- 'minor-dev', 'minor-rc', 'minor-lts'
- 'major-dev', 'major-rc', 'major-lts'

The release state machine in 'release_state.py' advances the counters and
the locked level as the press requires: a dev press of the locked level
adds one to DEV, a dev press opening a cycle or climbing to a higher level
locks that level, an rc press adds one to RC, and an lts press moves the
counters to the next line and sets LEVEL back to none. A press the state
machine refuses changes nothing: the script prints the refusal and fails.
The publish job of every button runs this script only after the publish
succeeded, so a failed publish never records a version.
