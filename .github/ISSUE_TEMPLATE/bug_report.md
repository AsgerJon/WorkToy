**Welcome**
Thank you for taking the time to submit a bug report! Before you start writing, consider recording a short video demonstration where you explain what happens. That is almost certainly more helpful than any written bug report. 

Regardless of how you submit your bug report, you are invited to read the rules below. Although, if you are here to submit a bug report and nothing else, you are very unlikely to inadvertently violate any rule.  
***RULES***
- Please keep rick-rolling at a moderate level.
- Political opinions are not welcome. 
- Mentioning political issues is not welcome. 
- Referring to any political activism of any kind is not welcome.
- Do not mention the name of any person holding, seeking to hold or having held political office or power (monarchies are exempted)
- Keep opinions on matters of technology. For example: You are quite welcome to share your estimations of the merits of certain proprietary operating systems. 
- **IMPORTANT**: Any obscene content will not be regarded as an attempt at humour but will result in immediate and permanent exclusion. This document does not contain legal advice, but please understand that this author believes that transmitting unsolicited obscene material not only causes real and actual harm but also amounts to criminal conduct. As such, violators should expect the involvement of law enforcement. If you feel urges to violate this rule, you are encouraged to seek the services of a mental health professional.

As mentioned, you are welcome to submit a short video explaining the bug. Alternatively, you may submit a written report if you really want to.

**Screen-Recording**
Videos can more effectively illustrate issues than written descriptions. Here are some ways to create your report:

***Phone Recording***
Your smartphone is likely capable of recording an adequate explanation of the issue. This method is simple and usually sufficient.

***OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)***
For a more professional-quality video, use OBS. This is especially useful if you are also providing an audio explanation.

***Code Recorders***
For code-related issues, consider using recording features available in your IDE or through a plugin.

**Video Content**
Your video should clearly demonstrate the problem with a coherent audible explanation.

**Written Bug Report**
If you prefer writing, please follow this format:

**Description**
Clearly describe what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Detail all necessary steps to reproduce the issue.

**Expected Behavior**
Describe what you expected to happen.

By adhering to these rules, you help maintain a professional and respectful environment that is conducive to productive collaborations. Thank you for your contributions and for ensuring the highest standards of conduct.
